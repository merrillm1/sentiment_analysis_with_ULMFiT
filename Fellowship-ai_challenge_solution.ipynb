    "The Yelp reviews dataset consists of reviews from Yelp. It is extracted from the Yelp Dataset Challenge 2015 data. For more information, please refer to http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "The Yelp reviews polarity dataset is constructed by Xiang Zhang (xiang.zhang@nyu.edu) from the above dataset. It is first used as a text classification benchmark in the following paper: Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, Yann LeCun. Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28 (NIPS 2015).\n",

    "DESCRIPTION\n",
    "\n",
    "The Yelp reviews polarity dataset is constructed by considering stars 1 and 2 negative, and 3 and 4 positive. For each polarity 280,000 training samples and 19,000 testing samples are take randomly. In total there are 560,000 trainig samples and 38,000 testing samples. Negative polarity is class 1, and positive class 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The files train.csv and test.csv contain all the training samples as comma-sparated values. There are 2 columns in them, corresponding to class index (1 and 2) and review text. The review texts are escaped using double quotes (\"), and any internal double quote is escaped by 2 double quotes (\"\"). New lines are escaped by a backslash followed with an \"n\" character, that is \"\\n\".\n",

It seems that his staff simply never answers the phone.  It usually takes 2 hours of repeated calling to get an answer.  Who has time for that or wants to deal with it?  I have run into this problem with many other doctors and I just don't get it.  You have office workers, you have patients with medical needs, why isn't anyone answering the phone?  It's incomprehensible and not work the aggravation.  It's with regret that I feel that I have to give Dr. Goldberg 2 stars.\",\n",

It is because of him, not my now former gyn Dr. Markoff, that I found out I have fibroids. He explores all options with you and is very patient and understanding. He doesn't judge and asks all the right questions. Very thorough and wants to be kept in the loop on every aspect of your medical health and your life.\",\n",
       " \"I don't know what Dr. Goldberg was like before  moving to Arizona, but let me tell you, STAY AWAY from this doctor and this office. I was going to Dr. Johnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them. I have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until I met this pathetic excuse for a doctor who is all about the money.\",\n",

He recommended to me that I get a physical, and he knew I was a student because I told him. I got the physical done. Later, I found out my health insurance doesn't pay for preventative visits. I received an $800.00 bill for the blood work. I can't pay for my bill because I'm a student and don't have any cash flow at this current time. I can't believe the Doctor wouldn't give me a heads up to make sure my insurance would cover work that wasn't necessary and was strictly preventative.
